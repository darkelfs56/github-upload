      <h3>Converts main AC to low-voltage regulated DC power. <br>
        How to choose the best PSU:</h3>
      1. Power Output <br>
      How much power you need depends on how much the components need power.
      Buy a higher watt power supply to be safe as there is no wrong in having more
      power.
      <hr>
      2. Efficiency <br>
      How much DC power it send to the PC and how much it will lost to heat. Typically we
      would recommend getting the 80 Plus certificate power supply to get the most efficiency
      <hr>
      3. Modularity of Cables <br>
      There is 3 type of modularity of PSU. <br>
      a. Non-Modular - all cable attached.<br>
      b. Semi-Modular - essential cables pre attached <br>
      c. Full-modular - no cables pre attached <br>
      Typically, with money we go with full modular so we can plug only the cables we use
      thus saving space and especially helps with cable management.

    <h1>Cooler fan</h1>
    <h4>Thee's two types of cooler fan in a personal computer, there is the case fan and the cpu cooler fan</h4>
  </div>
  <hr>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column" id="left1">
      <h3>Case fan</h3>
      <h4>The thing we need to consider is:</h4>
      <hr>
      <div>
        1. Fan size <br>
        It varies from 25 mm to 200 mm and above. The bigger your case, the bigger the fan you can put to
        accomodate the flow of air. Though the bigger the fan, the slower the speed but the less noise it makes
        <hr>
        2. Fan speed <br>
        Fan speed affects the temperature of the PC. Bigger fans can push out and pull in more air
        but produce more noise. Smaller fans are faster but suck in less air or push out less than their
        bigger counter part
        <hr>
        3. Bearing types <br>
        There are 3 types of bearing, namely sleeve, ball and hydronynamic <br>
        a. Hydrodynamics can lubricate themsleves and operate on the lowest noise levels but they are the highest price <br>
        b. Ball bearing can work at long period but produce more noise. More suitable for server building or if the computer
        is not in the same room as the user. <br>
        c. Rifle type have a shorter lifespan but it fits the compromise of cost, efficiency and noise level.

      <h3>CPU cooler</h3>
      <h4>Two type of CPU cooler:</h4>
      <hr>
      <div>
        1. Air coolers <br>
        Made up of combination of metal heatsinks and fans. They are the simplest form of cooling in which
        we only use fans to cool down the heated CPU. So we can expect some fan noise if the PC is under
        pressure or "load".
        <hr>
        2. All-in-One (AIO) <br>
        Also known as closed-loop coolers, much quiter than air coolers but with more higher cooling power.
        They use water with a coolant inside the tubes to cool down the CPU. Though sounds better than air coolers
        it is much more pricier than the standard air coolers.
