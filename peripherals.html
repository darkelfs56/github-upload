      Monitor is the display used to do work on a PC.<br>
      Key Features:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Resolution:</strong><br> This refers to the amount of pixels in the display. In general, bigger number equals better display.
        The most common resolution is Full HD or 1920 x 1080 for general use, however there are bigger resolution such as 4k and above.
        It is important to note that when choosing a resolution, the processors can handle the workload.</li>
      <li><strong>Refresh rate:</strong><br> This refers to how often the display updates the screen. For general use 60 Hz is enough. For gaming, 144 Hz is recommended.</li>
      <li><strong>Size:</strong><br> This refers to the size of the display measured diagonally. For general use and professional use, 22-32 inch should be enough.
        For gaming, it is up to your budget and the type of game you want to play as it can get up to 50 inch or more.</li>
      <li><strong>Type:</strong><br>This refers to the type of panel the display uses (TN/VA/IPS). TN monitors are the fastest but cheapest,
        due to poorer image quality when viewing from a side angle. IPS monitors have slightly faster response times and show color
        better than VA panels, but VA monitors have the best contrast out of all three panel types. For professional uses,
        IPS is recommended for its viewing angle and colors. For gaming, TN is recommended for its fast response times and refresh rate.</li>
    </ul>

      Mouse is a device used to navigate a computer screen.<br>
      Key Features:
    <ul>
      <li>DPI: <br> This refers to the sensitivity of the mouse in dots per inch (DPI). Higher DPI means that less
        physical movement is required to move the cursor across the screen. For gaming, a mouse with a customizable
        DPI is recommended so that you can change the DPI depending on game type or use.
      </li>
      <li>Ergonomics: <br> This refers to the design of the mouse and how it affects our well-being. A good mouse design can increase
        comfort and overall experience. It also help when using the mouse for an extended period of time. A bad mouse design can feel awkward when held in hand.
      </li>
      <li>Connection: <br> This refers to what type of connection used by the mouse. The connection of a mouse can be wired or wireless. Depending on
        which type you are comfortable with. The only advantage wired mouse have over wireless is that it is more consistent in its response times.
        If response times is not a concern for you then, it does not really matter. If you don't mind having a cable dangling out or you can organise the cable well enough, you might consider
        getting a wired mouse. If you don't like to organise cable or find cable annoying, wireless mouse is most likely a better choice.
      </li>
      <li>Buttons: <br> This refers to the amount buttons that a mouse have and whether they are programmable or not. Programmable buttons means
        that you can change the bind of the button. If for example your work involve a lot of undo, you might consider binding ctrl + z to one of
        the buttons. Or if you use push-to-talk on discord calls, you might consider binding the push-to-talk button to the mouse. Having programmable
        buttons is not necessary if you are just using the PC for general use.

      Keyboard is an input device used to enter alphabets, number, symbols and other commands.<br>
      Key Features:
    <ul>
      <li>Switch type: <br> This refers to the type of mechanism used in the keys of the keyboard. The three common types are rubber
        dome switch, scissor switch and Cherry MX switches. Rubber dome switch is popular in cheap keyboards. Scissor switch is
        normally used in laptop keyboards. Cherry MX switches are mainly used for gaming and there are a lot of varieties available.
        For more info on Cherry MX switches and its varieties pls go to this <a href="https://www.hyperxgaming.com/us/keyboards/switches#:~:text=CHERRY%20MX%20Red%20and%20CHERRY,enjoy%20the%20edge%20in%20speed.">link.</a>
      </li>
      <li>Size: <br> This refers to the design and the size of the case. Common ones are 100% or a full size keyboard with numpad and 60%
        which is the size of keyboard on most laptops. Mostly this part depends on personal preferences. There is no real advantage or disadvantage
        among the different sizes.
      </li>
      <li>RGB: <br> This refers to whether RGB lighting is available on the keyboard or not. This part also is just personal preference. No real advantage or disadvantage.</li>
      <li>Connection: <br> This refers the connection type, whether it is wired or wireless. Wired keyboard are more consistent in response times. So if your PC use requires
        very good response times, it is better to go wired. On the other hand, if you are not in need of very good response times, wireless is good too. In general, wired mouse
        is cheaper.
