      <h3>Converts main AC to low-voltage regulated DC power. <br>
        How to choose the best PSU:</h3>
      1. Power Output <br>
      How much power you need depends on how much the components need power.
      Buy a higher watt power supply to be safe as there is no wrong in having more
      power.
      <hr>
      2. Efficiency <br>
      How much DC power it send to the PC and how much it will lost to heat. Typically we
      would recommend getting the 80 Plus certificate power supply to get the most efficiency
      <hr>
      3. Modularity of Cables <br>
      There is 3 type of modularity of PSU. <br>
      a. Non-Modular - all cable attached.<br>
      b. Semi-Modular - essential cables pre attached <br>
      c. Full-modular - no cables pre attached <br>
      Typically, with money we go with full modular so we can plug only the cables we use
      thus saving space and especially helps with cable management.

    <h1>Cooler fan</h1>
    <h4>Thee's two types of cooler fan in a personal computer, there is the case fan and the cpu cooler fan</h4>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="column" id="left1">
      <h3>Case fan</h3>
      <h4>The thing we need to consider is:</h4>
      <hr>
      <div>
        1. Fan size <br>
        It varies from 25 mm to 200 mm and above. The bigger your case, the bigger the fan you can put to
        accomodate the flow of air. Though the bigger the fan, the slower the speed but the less noise it makes
        <hr>
        2. Fan speed <br>
        Fan speed affects the temperature of the PC. Bigger fans can push out and pull in more air
        but produce more noise. Smaller fans are faster but suck in less air or push out less than their
        bigger counter part
        <hr>
        3. Bearing types <br>
        There are 3 types of bearing, namely sleeve, ball and hydronynamic <br>
        a. Hydrodynamics can lubricate themsleves and operate on the lowest noise levels but they are the highest price <br>
        b. Ball bearing can work at long period but produce more noise. More suitable for server building or if the computer
        is not in the same room as the user. <br>
        c. Rifle type have a shorter lifespan but it fits the compromise of cost, efficiency and noise level.

      <h3>CPU cooler</h3>
      <h4>Two type of CPU cooler:</h4>
      <hr>
      <div>
        1. Air coolers <br>
        Made up of combination of metal heatsinks and fans. They are the simplest form of cooling in which
        we only use fans to cool down the heated CPU. So we can expect some fan noise if the PC is under
        pressure or "load".
        <hr>
        2. All-in-One (AIO) <br>
        Also known as closed-loop coolers, much quiter than air coolers but with more higher cooling power.
        They use water with a coolant inside the tubes to cool down the CPU. Though sounds better than air coolers
        it is much more pricier than the standard air coolers.

    <h1>Thermal Paste</h1>

  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">
      <div>
        Thermal Paste is a compound that is a heat conductive substance applied between the heatsink
        and the device it's meant to cool. <br>The heatsink will push out excess heat energy produced by the
        processor away from the unit and sent it to the fan or other cooling apparatus.
        <hr>
        How to choose? <br>
        1. Know the thermal conductivity of the paste. A liquid metal thermal paste may have a high watts per meter of
        surface(W/mk), whule a non-metallic thermal paster have a lower W/mk.
        <hr>
        2. Liquid metal thermal paste is much more harder to apply because of its lower density. The non-metallic
        counterpart have a higher viscosirt so its like an actual paste. It is much more easier to apply compare
        to a liquid type.
        <hr>
        3. Thermal paste need to be applied carefully, if it leaks to the motherboard it may damage any nearby
        small components.

        There's not much to say about this. All cables in a Personal Computer is pretty the same unless you choose to buy coloured ones
        to coordinate with your build. It's all aesthetics and personal touch only. Most of the cables that are used comes from either
        the case or from the PSU box. <br>
        Every cable that needs power like the ATX power connection for the supplying power for the motherboard and CPU, PCIe connection
        for supplying power for the graphic card and also other miscellaneous parts that need power like SATA for memory and case fans needed
        to be properly connected to the connection in the PSU. Luckily for consumers, most cables are already labelled for convinence during
        production. <br>
        Plus nowadays, building a computer is easy as most components can only go one way and most of it have specific number of pins
        that need to be connect to.
